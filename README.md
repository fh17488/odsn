# Opinion Dynamics on Social Networks
The project explores an established model of opinion dynamics from the literature in a new setting: a structured population in which a spatial population of moderates may be influenced by extremists of two types, with each of these extremist populations focusing their influence on a particular part of the moderate network â€“ as if a city of moderates featured two enclaves of extremists with opposing ideas. The model is novel in the sense that it considers the spatial structure of the population and the coupling between the moderates and extremists, and how this spatial structure might influence opinion dynamics outcomes - it involves development of new code but also benefits from code made available by authors of a prior study.
